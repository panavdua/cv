                    <p>Hello, I am a 2nd-year Computer Science Undergraduate at the National University of Singapore (expected to graduate in 2025). In the coming few years, I plan to specialize in Software Engineering and Algorithms and Efficiency.</p>
                    <p>As an aspiring technopreneur, I aim to delve into the EdTech (Education Technology) space to improvise upon the current education system in tandem with the paradigms outlined in Society 5.0, and more specifically, Education 4.0.</p>
                    <p>Some of my other passions include part-time tutoring, reading (personal-development books in particular), and football. Among the non-negotiable traits in my life, work-ethic and time-management top the list.</p>
                    <p>I would love to connect and meet new people who share similar interests, passions, or beliefs. Feel free to reach out either here on Linkedin, or on my mail -> <b>panavdua@gmail.com</b></p></td>
